Well I say widgets...

This currently contains:
    A customisable, working and neat console widget that can as a JFrame or as a JPanel and has input and output sorted.        
            I should document it but the code should suffice for now.
            
How to use:
    1. Download the latest jar file from release if the compilance level of your project is 1.8 OR compile it yourself.
    2. Add it as a library. Don't know how? Google it or use your favourite search engine.
    3. Create an object for the widget you want:
    
    An example for the console widget:
       
  ```  consoleWindow c = new consoleWindow("Test Window",new Color(255,255,255)
				, new Color(0 ,0, 0), new Color(20,20,20), new Dimension(900,900)
				, true, JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE, 18, "Courier");
  ```
    Use ctrl+space (or equivalent for your IDE) to see the methods for your object (write c. first or whatever you named the object). 
                
    I hope it is good enough for you. :)
